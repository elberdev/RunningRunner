# RunningRunner

### It's a running game (practicing learning some key concepts in Unity)

#### Takeaways:
* Learned to create a simple modified version of Unity's standard touch input controls.
* Learned about [Platform Dependent Compilation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html) and how to implement it in my scripts:
```
#if UNITY_IOS
	// do some stuff
#endif
```
